PipelineProject_Walter_McCain
This pipeline project aims to download and process DNA sequence data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and perform transcript quantification using Kallisto.

What the project does
The project downloads DNA sequence data from NCBI and processes it to extract coding sequences. Then, it uses Kallisto to perform transcript quantification on the processed data.

Why the project is useful
The project can be used to analyze gene expression in various organisms by downloading sequence data from NCBI and performing transcript quantification. This can help researchers understand how gene expression is regulated under different conditions.

Tools Used
Python
Biopython
Kallisto

How users can get started with the project
To get started with the project, users need to have Python, Biopython, and Kallisto installed on their machine. They can then clone the repository and run the Python script. The script will automatically download the sequence data, process it, and perform transcript quantification.
